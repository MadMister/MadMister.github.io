                            When using WMP My Portfolio, WMP’s clients shall comply with all security instructions as detailed in the initial set-up documentation package issued to the client and/or other information that has been and/or will be provided to the client in respect of WMP My Portfolio. In this regard, the client has an obligation to adopt the method determined, or to be determined, by WMP in order to verify that connection to (the website/app of) WMP has in fact been established and to change the username and password issued personally to the client in accordance with the instructions provided by WMP.
                        </p>
                        <p  class="contentParagraph">
                            The username and the password are exclusively issued to the client by WMP and are strictly personal. The client must maintain secrecy in respect of the username and password issued to him and uses them with the requisite care. The identification codes are strictly personal and may not be disclosed to third parties under any circumstances. The client is personally responsible and liable for all instances in which the identification codes are used. The client must notify WMP if: a) the identification codes are lost, stolen, misused or forged; b) he knows or suspects that third parties are aware of the identification codes; c) he discovers irregularities relating to the functionality that is offered. The client must confirm the aforementioned notification to WMP in written form, by fax or electronically. Each notification must state the date, time and location of the report. The client is liable for the damage that ensues from loss, theft or misuse of his username and/or his password, until the time when WMP is informed of the loss or theft. In the event of loss, theft or misuse of the username and/or the password code, or if they fall into the hands of unauthorized persons in any other way, the client must, upon discovery, contact his account manager at WPM without delay and ask him to block access to the website/app. After taking cognizance of a request of this nature, WMP will immediately block access to WMP My Portfolio and, if necessary, take further action in order to prevent misuse. The client has an obligation to report this as quickly as possible to WMP, but in any case within 5 working days. During the period from the time of the first report as indicated above, the client is liable for the consequences of the unauthorized use or misuse of the username and/or the password. Messages that you send to WMP by email can be intercepted or manipulated in other ways. WMP advises you not to send confidential or sensitive information to WMP by email. If you choose to send messages to WMP by email, you accept the risk that these messages will be intercepted or otherwise manipulated by a third party. WMP will never ask you for your password or other confidential or sensitive information by email and is not liable for damage if access to information is obtained by (unauthorized) parties through phishing or by adopting a false (email) identity.

                            Using WMP My Portfolio implies the electronic exchange of information by means of public communications media and the Internet. The Internet is an international open network and the client acknowledges that he is aware of the open structure. WMP undertakes to take all reasonable action to ensure a high level of security by applying security measures at different levels. However, WMP neither explicitly nor implicitly offers any guarantee regarding the security of WMP My Portfolio. The client undertakes to implement adequate security measures with regard to connecting to the Internet and/or the computer configuration used for this purpose - in the form of the software and operating system, updates, firewall and virus scanners. WMP reserves the right to deny access to the website/app in the event of non-compliance with the requirements stipulated in these terms and conditions of use.
